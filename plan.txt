What are the core components of the game?

1. player-controlled sprite that jumps over objects
    - player only controls the sprite jumps, not vertical or left/right movement
    - the absolute position of the sprite is constant
2. obstacles and platforms on the map that the sprite can interact with
    - when you touch a spike -> die -> restart level
    - platforms that sprite can go onto
3. scrolling game that moves map horizontally
4. score in the game: get to the end of level 
    - each level takes abosolute amount of time to finish
    

Stretch goals:
1. special objects that sprite interacts with
    - orb to flip upside down and boost jumps
2. Coins

- Player/sprite

    class Player():
        - position: coordinates 
        - isAlive: boolean
        - onGround: boolean 
        - wonLevel: boolean
        - jumpstrength: integer
        - spriteImage: -> image file

        - jump()
        - collide() # check if it is touching something (spike, orb, platform, etc...)
        - death()
        - update()

- Map 
    class Spike():
        - position: coordinates
        - image: image file

    class Block():
        - position: coordinates
        - image : file
    
    class End():
        - position
        - image

-Screens:
- Start Screen
    - play button
    - level selection
    - sprite image selection
    - quit button

- Death Screen
    - message
    - score display
    - attempt count

- Won Screen

    - exit level/main men
    - restart

What is left:

Level loading/creation:
 ☑ 1. Reading in a csv value to a list of lists
 ☑ 2. Load the numbers into corresponding objects

Game initialization code:
☑ load the level list
☑ load all map sprite images
 ☑ load font
☑ initialize progress variables to 0
    ☑ number of attempts
    ☑ current screen position 
☑ set screen size
☑  start the music
☑ load background image
☑ create necesary objects -> Player
- render the start/welcome page (include intro text)
☑ start the main loop 

Main Loop:
☑ main driver function for all the game play

Screen transition functions:
1. wait_for_input()
2. reset_level()

Connecting all the pieces:
how to call functions from different files/classes
how to pass around information from class to class
    - using a DAO class?
        - data access objects

Test out the game
